Compatibility Notes

* v6: tagging the v6-rc without any further changes in the compatibility

* v6-rc: the CSV format changes: type removed from the header

  More information on https://github.com/bandilab/bandicoot/issues/23

  All communication with Bandicoot needs to change. The first line in the
  input/output does not contain the "attr_name attr_type" pairs anymore. It
  expects a comma separated list of "attr_name" instead.

  old:
      title string,pages int,price real,genre string
      Robinson Crusoe,312,11.21,Novel

  new:
      title,pages,price,genre
      Robinson Crusoe,312,11.21,Novel

* v5: synax changes: calling conventions, type declarations

  Use "bandicoot convert" to transform programs to the v5 syntax. Keep in mind
  that bandicoot stores the currently deployed version of your program as
  ".source" in the data directory ("-d" startup argument). This program needs
  to be converted as well.

* v4: backward compatible with v3

* v3: startup arguments have changed.

  The deploy action has been removed, and the start action has more parameters.
  Also, more actions have been added for a distributed version. Please do
  ./bandicoot to see the usage info.

* v2: volume structure is not backward compatible.

  Therefore it is not possible to run the v2 on top of a volume created by an
  older version. To migrate the data it is required to export all your data
  first, and then re-importÂ it back.
