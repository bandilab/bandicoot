Bandicoot - http://bandilab.org

Compatibility Notes

* v3: startup arguments have changed.

  The deploy action has been removed, and the start action has more parameters.
  Also, more actions have been added for a distributed version. Please do
  ./bandicoot to see the usage info.

* v2: volume structure is not backward compatible.

  Therefore it is not possible to run the v2 on top of a volume created by an
  older version. To migrate the data it is required to export all your data
  first, and then re-importÂ it back.
